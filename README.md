# KICKOFF - Football Match Predictions

    KICKOFF is a project that uses machine learning to predict the outcome of Football matches for the World Cup 2022. The project uses Python, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Pandas, and Numpy libraries to build the model.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, you need to install the following packages:
* Python 3
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Numpy


## Datasets
The project uses the following three datasets:

fifa_ranking_2022-10-06.csv: This dataset contains the latest FIFA rankings of teams before the World Cup 2022. The data is used to help predict the outcome of matches based on the current rankings of the teams.

international_matches.csv: This dataset contains all international matches played from 1993 to 2022. The data is used to analyze the historical performance of national teams and make predictions based on their past performance.

matchs-schedule.csv: This dataset contains the schedule of the World Cup 2022. The data is used to predict the outcome of matches during the tournament.

## Prediction
The prediction for the winner of the World Cup 2022 made by KICKOFF is Argentina with an accuracy of 68%.

## File Description
The project has the following file:

KICKOFF-IS499-V1.3.ipynb: This file contains all the data cleaning and the model and the results. It includes the following sections:
Data Loading
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis
Feature Engineering
Model Building and Training
Model Evaluation
Prediction and Results
Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open the KICKOFF-IS499-V1.3.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
Run the cells in the notebook from top to bottom to clean the data, build the model, evaluate the model and predict the outcome of the matches.

## Conclusion
This project shows how the Random Forest algorithm can be used to predict the outcome of Football matches. The accuracy of the model can be improved by adding more features and using more advanced Machine Learning algorithms. However, it is important to note that predictions are based on historical data and may not always be accurate.
